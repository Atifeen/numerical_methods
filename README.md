# Numerical Methods Console Application

We created this project which is a console-based application that implements a variety of numerical methods used for scientific and engineering computations. This repository provides code implementations for several key numerical methods, allowing users to understand, practice, and apply these techniques.

## About

The "Numerical Methods Console Application" offers a range of numerical algorithms designed to solve a variety range of mathematical equations and matrix inversion using computational techniques. These methods are frequently used in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics to approximate solutions to complex equations.

This project is built using the C++ programming language, providing a command-line interface (CLI) for easy access to various numerical methods.

## Features

- *Methods for Linear Equations*:
  - Jacobi Method
  - Gauss-Seidel Method
  - Gauss Elimination
  - Jordan Elimination
  - LU Factorization

- *Methods for Non-Linear Equations*:
  - Bisection Method
  - False Position 
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - Secant Method
  
- *Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)*:
  - Runge-Kutta Method

- *Matrix Invertion*:
  - Reduced to Normal Form

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atifeen/numerical_methods.git
   cd numerical_methods
   
   

2. Run the application:
   bash
   python -u main.py
   

## Usage

Once the application is started, follow the prompts to select the desired numerical method. Input the required parameters as prompted by each method.

For example:
- Choose a method from the menu.
- Enter the necessary parameters (like which method you want to choose, initial guesses, step size in Runge-Kutta method, etc).
- View the output, which includes the approximate solution and steps taken by the method.
